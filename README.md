## 📌 About the project
An interactive web application for searching IT literature using a real API (ITBookStore). The project allows users to track new releases, search for books by keywords, and filter them by price (paid/free). 

The goal of the project is to practice working with API requests, data filtering, and creating a responsive interface in React.
